# unit-4-game

Game starts when a crystal is clicked.
Each crystal generates a random number.
Target number randomly generates per game.

Each crystal number has a set number until the game is won or lost, then resets.


If currentSum === randomGen, +1 win
If currentSum > randomGen, +1 Loss
If currentSum < randomGen, add the clicked number to the currentSum.
Function resets randomGen, currentSum, and crystal numbers each game.
