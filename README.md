Each crystal generates a random number.
Target number randomly generates.

Each crystal number stays until the game is won or lost, then resets.

Come up with a function:
If currentSum === randomGen, +1 win
If currentSum > randomGen, +1 Loss
If currentSum < randomGen, add the clicked number to the currentSum.
